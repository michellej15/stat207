    "Suppose that a Calculus student is curious about the proportion of former Calculus students that got A's in the class that they are currently enrolled in (taught by Dr. Difficult). This class has had thousands of students enrolled in the past. The student collects a random sample of 60 former students who have taken the class and asks them if they got an A in the class (or not). 40% of the students in the sample got an A.\n",

    "This student also knows that the proportion of all students who took another Calculus class (taught by Dr. Eezee) and got an A was 0.80. The student would like to determine if there is evidence to suggest that the proportion of students who have taken Dr. Difficult's class that get A's is *different* than the the proportion of students who have taken Dr. Eezee's class that get A's.\n",
